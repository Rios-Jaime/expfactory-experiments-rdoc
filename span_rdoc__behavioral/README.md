# Span (simple & operation) Description
Simple span

Operation span

## Span (simple & operation) trial timing
- test trial
inter-stimulus : 3000ms
to-be-remembered stim : 1000ms (1000ms stim presentation)
---- repeats 4 times
response : 5000ms
ITI : 5000ms (mean), 2000ms (min), 20000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
26000ms trial duration 
* 3 blocks 
* 8 trials per block 
* 2 (simple & operation)
/ 1000 
/ 60
= 20.8min
```

- practice trial
inter-stimulus : 3000ms
to-be-remembered stim : 1000ms (1000ms stim presentation)
---- repeats 4 times
response : 5000ms
feedback : 500ms
ITI : 5000ms (mean), 2000ms (min), 20000ms (max)

--- 
```code 
26500ms trial duration 
* 1 block
* 1 trials per block 
* 2 (simple & operation)
/ 1000 
/ 60
= .883min for 1 practice block of simple and 1 practice block of operation
```

# Span (simple & operation) Conditions
(block-level)
simple span : 50%
operation span: 50%

3 test blocks
8 test trials for each test block
= 24 test trials total 

3 practice blocks (maxiumum)
4 trials for practice
= 3 practice trials minimum
= 12 practice trials maximum

(Practice is repeated twice, once for simple span and once again for operation span. So, it's possible a subject could do 24 (6 blocks * 4 trials per block) practice trials.)

Trial-level Accuracy Threshold = .60
Symmetric Judgement Threshold (t/f) = 0.50

Note: practice moves to test if practice block accuracy is > .60 or if current practice block is their third attempt and if symmetric judgement accuracy was over 50%

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 1 - Order of operation span/simple span is randomized (50%/50%)
#### For Operation Span
Sub-task #1
In this sub-task, you will first encounter an 8x8 grid filled with black and grey cells. You have to determine if the grid is symmetric or not. Press the t key if the grid is symmetric and press the f key if it is not.

When you make a response, a new 8x8 grid will immediately appear, and you should complete as many correct symmetry judgements as you can. Then a single 4x4 grid will appear. This grid will have one cell colored black. Try to remember the location of the black cell.

This sequence of 8x8 grids and 4x4 grid will alternative four times. After the fourth time, a blank 4x4 grid will be presented.

On the blank 4x4 grid, use the arrow keys to navigate the grid and the spacebar to select the cells you think were colored black in the preceding 4 4x4 grids. Please select them in the order they were shown (i.e., respond with the location of the first black square in the 4x4 grid, then the 2nd, …).

#### For Simple Span
Sub-task #2
In this sub-task, you will see a fixation (****) followed by a 4x4 grid. This 4x4 grid will have one cell colored black. Try to remember the location of the black cell.

This sequence of a fixation (****) and 4x4 grid will alternate four times. After the fourth time, a blank 4x4 grid will be presented.

On the blank 4x4 grid, use the arrow keys to navigate the grid and the spacebar to select the cells you think were colored black in the preceding 4 4x4 grids. Please select them in the order they were shown (i.e., respond with the location of the first black square in the 4x4 grid, then the 2nd, …).

### Task-Specific Instructions - Page 2
During the practice round, you will receive feedback and reminders of the rules. These will be removed for the actual test, so ensure that you understand the instructions before proceeding.

Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
